# Inexor

Inexor is a fork of the quake-like Cube-derived Cube 2: Sauerbraten
It adds a lot of features and tries to stay open for improvements and suggestion.
It wants to be more flexible and be the superseder of Sauerbraten.. 
It's also a goal to create a environment where development of the game or engine is easy and fast and creativity can achieve prosperity.

More information is available on Inexor Wiki.

### Engine Features

* See wiki for actual list of engine features
* Cube 2 Engine Features

 * 6 directional heightfield in octree world structure allowing for instant easy in-game geometry editing (even in multiplayer, coop edit).
 * Rendering engine optimized for high geometry throughput, supporting hardware occlusion culling and software precomputed conservative PVS with occluder fusion.
 * Lightmap based lighting with accurate shadows from everything including mapmodels, smooth lighting for faceted geometry, and fast compiles. Soft shadowmap based shadows for dynamic entities.
 * Pixel and vertex shader support, each model and world texture can have its own shader assigned. Supports normal and parallax mapping, specular and dynamic lighting with bloom and glow, environment-mapped and planar reflections/refractions, and post-process effects.
 * Loading of md2/md3/md5/obj/smd/iqm models for skeletal and vertex animated characters, weapons, items, and world objects. Supports animation blending, procedural pitch animation, and ragdoll physics for skeletally-animated characters.
 * Simple stereo positional sound system.
 * Particle engine, supporting text particles, volumetric explosions, soft particles, and decals.
 * 3d menu/gui system, for in-world representation of choices.
