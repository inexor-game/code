#### InexorFlex manages InexorCore

InexorFlex is the node.js part.
InexorCore is what one would have called Inexor/Sauerbraten before (the C++ part).

  * Instances Framework
     * Moving  configuration Loading from Inexor Core to Inexor Flex side needed startup changes
         * First start Inexor Flex, then Inexor Core.
     * Manage and run multiple instances of Inexor Core
          * Configure instances using configuration files
          * Start instances of Inexor Core automatically

  * Profiles
      * Like Mozilla Firefox profiles
          * different settings for different profiles
      * Predefined configuration setups
          * client, server, serverfarm and development environments
      * Multiple InexorFlex on the same machine

  * Removed all git submodules
      * Replaced with InexorFlex auto update functionality
