#node-experimental

This is an experimental node webserver for Inexor, offering access to IPC/RPC

###How to set it up

1. Grab the repository
2. Launch the server app via node app/app.js
3. Make sure you launched Inexor/IPC, otherwise explicitely start it via */subsystem_start rpc*
4. You can now send RPC requests as application/json requests to localhost:48702 (use code as attribute)
